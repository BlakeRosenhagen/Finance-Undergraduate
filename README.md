# Finance-Undergraduate README
*A small collection of financial based projects that were created through my years at the university.*

  The projects vary in quality as some had been created during the early years at university, when I was first learning excel. Some of them I work with other people on a team, while some of them were solo projects. I have grown a lot since then, but I believe these projects are still worthy in showcasing my ability to build complex models.

All of these projects are finance focused as that was my degree in college. Check my other repos for my other projects that go much farther in subject and in use of technical tools than what is presented here.

### 3M Capital Budgeting Project
For this project we looked at the finances of a corporation from a bird's eye view. This had us break down how debt and equity were were managed in 3M, and our projections for its future. The main points of interest is the analysis on **capital structure, discounted cash flow,** and **dividend growth rates.**
### Buy vs Rent Financial Project	
In this project we were tasked to locate a residence in a set price range and a comparable residence to rent. By taking into account **allocation of debt, cash flows,** and **taxation** to name a few elements, we had to come to an final decision, to buy or to rent.
### Fundamental and Ratio Analysis	
My very first excel project in which we selected a company of our choice to analyze their financial statements and to then derive a multitude of **ratios** from them to assess their financial performance.
### Predicting Housing Prices	
This was me dipping my toe into "data analytics" as we used a multitude of potentially significant factors in a **linear regression** model to formulate a strategy on what would be smart investments for a real estate firm.
### Starbucks Pro Forma and WACC
Much of what I had learned in my degree was used at some point within this prohect as it required me to generate much of the variables that would have been just assumed. Now we had to procure a **Pro Forma** and the **Weighted Average Cost of Capital** from a multitude of financial formulas, concepts, and models.
